The production of magnets based on neodymium is a resource intensive process. ',NULL),(2,'LCP','manufacturing intensive products','For manufacturing intensive products, the processing of raw materials during manufacture causes the greatest relative environmental impact. Consumption of energy and materials in the manufacture determine, to a large extent, the overall environmental impact of the product. A typical every day item is a smartphone whose electrical components causes the greatest environmental impacts in the production phase. ​',NULL),(3,'LCP','distribution intensive products','For distribution intensive products, the environmental performance of the product is greatly influenced by transportation and packaging. Electric toothbrushes and their attachments, while lightweight, are often sold in large packages, making transportation the largest environmental impact. ',NULL),(4,'LCP','use intensive products','Environmental impacts in the use phase dominate the overall environmental impact of use intensive products. Consumption of energy and/or materials or the generation of waste during use largely defines the environmental performance of the (active) product. Typical products include intensively used dishwashers or washing machines. These products use a great quantity of water and electricity. ​',NULL),(5,'LCP','disposal intensive products','For disposal intensive products, the overall environmental impact is determined mainly by the form of disposal at the end of the product’s life (recycling, incineration, dumping). The greatest environmental impact is caused by products containing substances that are difficult or dangerous to dispose of. Large amounts of methane are produced when PLA (polylactic acid) water bottles are disposed of in landfills. ',NULL),(6,'CBM','sharing, P2P','Instead of selling the product itself, this CBM offers the use of a product for a limited period of time, for instance the use of a car. Another option is to offer a platform on which customers can search for products or offer their own products (P2P = Peer-to-Peer). This enables the full utilization of products that are rarely used when owned and used by a single customer. Popular example is a platform for finding rideshares or renting out things like power tools. ​',NULL),(7,'CBM','PSS','In addition to the product itself, complementary services are offered to maximize customer satisfaction. There are 3 categories within this CBM: A product-oriented PSS sells the product and additional service during its use phase for example maintenance services. With a use-oriented PSS, the customer is in possession but not ownership of the product. Popular example is the leasing of a car. Last, a result-oriented PSS sells only the desired functions/results of a product, e.g selling only the light instead of the lightbulbs.  ',NULL),(8,'CBM','repair & maintanance','Goal of the CBM is to extend the lifetime of a product which is achieved by offering repair and maintenance services. This enables superior product experience and customer loyalty and can be done by OEMs or external service providers. An example are power tool producer providing a repair and maintenance service for their products.',NULL),(9,'CBM','gap exploiter','The gap in the lifetime of different components of a product is the core business of a Gap Exploiter which often does not manufacture any products itself. Rather it takes over services such as repair, maintenance, warranties, and insurance, operating in cooperation with manufacturers and retailers or working independent. An example are web shops offering repair tools and parts for consumer electronics and appliances.',NULL),(10,'CBM','long lasting product design','To ensure a long life of a product this CBM focus on high-quality materials and designs. It combines with a high level of service often going together with a lifetime warranty by the manufacturer. The design of pens is often timeless and durable. ',NULL),(11,'CBM','upgrading','In order to satisfy new user needs, the product can be extended with additional functions through upgrades which requires a modular design. It also benefits from preventive and technical updates. For example, there are strollers whose seats can be upgraded for the child\'s age or extra parts added for siblings.',NULL),(12,'CBM','reuse & redestribution','After its first use phase a product undergoes minor improvements and adjustments to be sold with the original purpose. This prolongs the access to familiar products. New warranties increase customer confidence when providing lower product prices which can open new markets. For example, manufacturing machines are given to other factories after use, where they can be used again.',NULL),(13,'CBM','remanufacturing & refurbish','Products that have been used are sent to a manufacturer or other service provider to be repaired, receiving cosmetic updates or to be deeply remanufactured resulting in products as good as new. Single product components can also be remanufactured and used in new or other products. Different companies offer remanufactured products or parts. ',NULL),(14,'CBM','recycling, upcycling','Goal of this CBM is to close the loop of materials by using post-consumer/industrial waste for new products. In the process of Upcycling used materials/products/components are transformed into higher quality materials or products with improved functionality. The bottles of everyday items are made of 100% recycled plastic and can be recycled to a high standard thanks to their \"Design for Recycling\".',NULL),(16,'CBM','industrial symbiosis','In an industrial symbiosis secondary resource flows are shared between industrial actors creating a network. The waste or secondary resources can be utilized with different strategies: 1) as a replacement for (virgin) input, 2) to generate by-products or 3) to generate new products. These strategies can also be implemented within a company, which opens up new areas of business. A popular example is the cooperation of companies of different branches cooperating to share their resources.',NULL),(17,'CBM','circular supplies','Suppliers adopting circular practices offer products that are made from renewable, recyclable, or biodegradable inputs, thereby enabling a circular consumption system. The use of circular resources in a supply chain replaces linear types of resources, which can be helpful in managing scarce raw materials. ​Companies with this business model offer for example degradable fishing equipment or recyclable to-go packaging.',NULL),(18,'CBM','digitalisation','The shift from physical products, services, or processes to virtual alternatives can help reduce the number of products produced. Replacing hardware with service and software solutions can offer benefits to customers, while also enabling a flexible and resource-efficient way of working. A well-known example are software packages. Previously, a CD-ROM had to be purchased that contained the software and the license key. Today, this can be purchased online, and the software can be downloaded from the website. When streaming music or movies, physical products are also replaced.',NULL),(32,'ED','durability','Durability refers to the ability of a product to operate according to specific conditions of use, maintenance, and repair, until it is no longer able to function due to a limiting event.',NULL),(33,'ED','reliability','Reliability refers to the likelihood of a product operating as expected for a specified duration, without any significant incidents occurring, under specified conditions.',NULL),(34,'ED','reusability','A product is reusable if it or its components can be utilized for their original purpose after their first use phase.',NULL),(35,'ED','upgradability','An upgrade enhances the functionality, performance or aesthetic of a product which provides additional benefits for users.',NULL),(36,'ED','repairability','A product is repairable if, after damage, it can be restored to a condition in which it can fulfil its original purpose.',NULL),(37,'ED','maintenance / refurbishment','The possibility of refurbishment is given when a products functionality within the intended use can be restored.
